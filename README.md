Project: Color Picker Hooks

Project Focus: Create an HSL(a) color picker with React Hooks

Objectives

Respond to user events in React

<!-- Use hooks in react to drive changes to a user interface
Use props to drive inline styles to dynamically update the appearance of DOM elements
Understand RGB vs HSL color models
Use controlled form inputs in React -->

Represent the three values, hue, saturation, and lightness with hooks.
Add three sliders that update their respective values (hue, saturation, and lightness).
Display the color on the screen, in both text (i.e. hsl(50, 8%, 20%)) and the actual color as a background color on an element.
Add a button that picks a new random color.
